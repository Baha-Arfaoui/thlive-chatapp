# Treehouse Live - ChatApp UI with dark-mode

Welcome to our live code-along session! We will be building out a chat-app UI with a toggle-able dark mode. If you'd like to follow along with me, clone this repository down to your machine. You'll have everything you need here. All icons used are SVGs and live in the `images` folder. 

The full code will be found in this repo once the live session is over. Let's have some fun!
